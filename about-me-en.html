                                        I always put all my energy into my art major at the university, and I always gave it my all for my assignments, always trusting my sensibilities in my creative work, and as a result, I always maintained a 4.0 GPA in my major courses. In practical classes, I often received high marks from my professors for being the best student in the class. The experience of representing my class in this way gave me more confidence in my creativity and technique. I also learned the logic of Creative Thinking and developed the ability to create 1 from 0 and to develop 1 into 100 or more. I am convinced that I can be of service to your company and society by using this ability to create innovative ideas.
                                        At the university, I am entrusted with a job as a designer in the Japanese Student Association to which I belong. In this association, I had many opportunities to use my talents and strengths for the benefit of others and the organization, and I felt the greatest sense of fulfillment in knowing that my work was appreciated beyond the country. I intend to continue using my strength to benefit others and society. 
                                        My work is not conventional, and I have a wide range of styles. To this end, I continue to create works of art by learning the basics of drawing and other subjects thoroughly and then applying my creativity to break out of my mold one after another. I became interested in American Comics design when I was in middle school and have been influenced by numerous artists ever since. I was greatly influenced by the subtle, dynamic, comic-like, and realistic style of Jim Lee, a comic artist whose work I admire most, and under his influence, I began to do a lot of portraits. 
                                        I am confident that at your company, I can contribute to the development of ideas through creative thinking and unconventional originality to break out of conventional thinking and create new products and values.
